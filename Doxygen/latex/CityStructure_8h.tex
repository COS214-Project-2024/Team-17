\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \mbox{\hyperlink{classCityStructure}{City\+Structure}} class, representing a city with blocks and departments for budget allocation. 

This file defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{classCityStructure}{City\+Structure}} class, which models a cityâ€™s structure, including its blocks and departments. It supports tax processing and budget allocation to various departments, integrating with visitor classes for tax and budget management. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classCityStructure}{City\+Structure}} class interacts with \mbox{\hyperlink{classGovernment}{Government}} and policy classes to apply city-\/specific budgeting rules. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
