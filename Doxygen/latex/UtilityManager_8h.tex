\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \mbox{\hyperlink{classUtilityManager}{Utility\+Manager}} class, which serves as an abstract base class for utility services. 

This file defines the abstract \mbox{\hyperlink{classUtilityManager}{Utility\+Manager}} class, which represents the base functionality for various utility services in a city system.
